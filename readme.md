## Introduction 📄

This script uses the Gmail API to programmatically manage and clean up your Gmail inbox. Whether you have unread emails cluttering your inbox or spam that needs to be purged, this script makes the task easy.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

- Python 3.x
- Gmail account
- `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-auth-httplib2`, and `google-api-python-client` libraries.

## Features ✨

1. **Delete Unread Emails**: Clears all unread emails with a single command.
2. **Delete Spam**: Instantly clean out all messages in the spam folder.

## Setup 🛠

1. **Google Cloud Console Setup**: 
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project.
   - Enable Gmail API.
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and download the `credentials.json` file. Place it in the project directory.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```
     python3 -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```
     pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
     ```

3. **First-time Run**: 
   - On first run, the script will open a new browser window asking for Gmail permissions.
   - Authenticate and allow the script access.
   - This will generate a `token.pickle` file which will be used for subsequent authentications.

## Usage 💻

To delete unread emails:
```bash
python3 script_name.py delete_unread
```

To delete emails from the spam folder:

```bash
python3 script_name.py delete_spam
```

Replace script_name.py with the name of your script file.
